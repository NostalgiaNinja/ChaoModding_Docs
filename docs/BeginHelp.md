# Asking for help:

!!! note
    This is written in the context of asking for help in Discord on servers capable of helping you with your mod. Similar rules may apply for other places where you ask for help.

## Recommendations

If you're stuck and are asking for help, the following is usually needed:

* Information on where you're stuck
* (if needed) a packed Blender file
* (if needed) a snippet of your code
* (if needed) a screenshot of your output

Please provide as much information as possible on what you need help on. Doing so will alleviate the headaches of the people helping you. 

Asking "How do I" types of questions will get you pointed to the guides as they are there to give you a structured approach to completing your mod.

## How to pack a Blender File

Go to File -> External Data -> Pack Resources. This will make the .blend file bigger, but will come with all the model and texture information needed.

Save your file thereafter.

## How to send a snippet of code

Discord allows for markdown of the code you're sending. press the ++grave++ key to type the \` special character. Encase some text in one \` for a single-line comment. For example:

\`Some code here\`

Which will show up as this:

`Some code here`

Discord also allows for syntax-highlighted code using \`\`\` - You can also include a language! For example:

\`\`\`cpp

PrintDebug("Here");

\`\`\`

Which will show up as this:

```cpp
    #include "ExampleAnimal.mini"
```

It is recommended to use multiline code blocks (syntax-highlighted) so that it is easier for people to pinpoint your problem and explain a solution.

## How to take a screenshot of your output:

Windows has many ways to take a screenshot of your output. One example is the snipping tool shortcut:

++win+shift+s++

This opens an instant snipping tool window allowing you to quickly drag a rectangular region to copy into the clipboard. If you want to make changes before pasting into Discord, click your notification area and click the screenshot that you made, make the changes needed and click copy. You can then paste directly from the clipboard into Discord and type the description of what you need for help.

Another way is to use ++alt+prtsc++ to capture the window and paste it into your clipboard. If you want to edit the screenshot, open your image editor of choice and paste it there before pasting it or sending it into Discord.
