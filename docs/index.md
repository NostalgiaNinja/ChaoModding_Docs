# Welcome to the Chao World Modding Documentation

Documentation version: 2.2.0

This document serves to guide you through modding your Chao World, and is aimed at beginner modders looking to dip their feet into Sonic Adventure 2 Chao Modding.

This is a rehaul of the old modding documentation, which was initially only used for Chao World Extended modding. In future versions of this document, other mods will be included in the documentation. This is a working document and is always changing, so be sure to check back every so often for any nuggets of information that may be useful to you.
