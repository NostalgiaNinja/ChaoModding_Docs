# Welcome to the Chao World Modding Documentation

Documentation version: 2.0

This document serves to guide you through modding your Chao World, and is aimed at beginner modders looking to dip their feet into Sonic Adventure 2 Chao Modding.

This is a rehaul of the old modding documentation, which was initially only used for Chao World Extended modding. In future versions of this document, other mods will be included in the documentation.
