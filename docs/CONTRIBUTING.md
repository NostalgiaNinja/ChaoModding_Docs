# How to contribute to the Chao Modding Documentation:

The Chao Modding Documentation is written in [standard markdown formatting](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), and formatted through MKDocs with the MKDocs-Material theme. Contributing to the documentation allows for a centralized community space where modders can learn how to do stuff.

## Prerequisites

* Git
* A Github Account
* A Text Editor of choice (VSCode is recommended)

## Getting started

Fork the project by pressing the Fork button on Github on the [github repository](https://github.com/NostalgiaNinja/ChaoModding_Docs)/ and pull/clone your repository.

Create a branch of the forked repository, so that you can make changes as necessary.

Make changes as necessary, and commit and push your features.  

Don't forget to add the fork as an upstream remote! This will help when you open up a pull request on Github!

Push your commit to the branch you created.

Open your branch and submit a pull request. The main branch then gets a request from you with your contribution counting towards the project.

## Making changes

Open the .md file of choice that needs to be changed with an editor of choice.  Make the necessary changes and then save. Create a Pull Request with the changes and request for them to be pulled into the Master repository to be built.  Thereafter, it will be built into the main MKDocs repository.

## Creating new topics
